                   recent developments and experiences derived from a
                   decade of working with systems that increase access

                   observations, and analyzing the resulting data are
                   three indispensable phases of modern practice with
                   public-use data files and with many other statistical
                   applications. Each phase inherits different input,
                   including the information preceding it and the
                   intellectual assessments available, and aims to
                   provide output that is one step closer to arriving at
                   statistical inferences with scientific relevance.
                   However, the role of the imputation phase has often
                   been viewed as merely providing computational
                   convenience for users of data. Although facilitating
                   computation is very important, such a viewpoint
                   ignores the imputer's assessments and information
                   inaccessible to the users. This view underlies the
                   recent controversy over the validity of
                   multiple-imputation inference when a procedure for
                   analyzing multiply imputed data sets cannot be
                   derived from (is "uncongenial" to) the model adopted
                   for multiple imputation. Given sensible imputations
                   and complete-data analysis procedures, inferences
                   from standard multiple-imputation combining rules are
                   typically superior to, and thus different from,
                   users' incomplete-data analyses. The latter may
                   suffer from serious nonresponse biases because such
                   analyses often must rely on convenient but
                   unrealistic assumptions about the nonresponse
                   mechanism. When it is desirable to conduct inferences
                   under models for nonresponse other than the original
                   imputation model, a possible alternative to
                   recreating imputations is to incorporate appropriate
                   importance weights into the standard combining rules.
                   These points are reviewed and explored by simple
                   examples and general theory, from both Bayesian and
                   frequentist perspectives, particularly from the
                   randomization perspective. Some convenient terms are
                   suggested for facilitating communication among
                   researchers from different perspectives when
                   evaluating multiple-imputation inferences with
                   uncongenial sources of input.},

                   large-scale social science data face a difficult
                   challenge. They have to share data in ways that
                   protect privacy and confidentiality, are informative
                   for many analyses and purposes, and are relatively
                   straightforward to use by data analysts. One approach
                   suggested in the literature is that data stewards
                   generate and release synthetic data, i.e., data
                   simulated from statistical models, while also
                   providing users access to a verification server that
                   allows them to assess the quality of inferences from
                   the synthetic data. We present an application of the
                   synthetic data plus verification server approach to
                   longitudinal data on employees of the U.S. federal
                   government. As part of the application, we present a
                   novel model for generating synthetic career
                   trajectories, as well as strategies for generating
                   high dimensional, longitudinal synthetic datasets. We
                   also present novel verification algorithms for
                   regression coefficients that satisfy differential
                   privacy. We illustrate the integrated use of
                   synthetic data plus verification via analysis of
                   differentials in pay by race. The integrated system
                   performs as intended, allowing users to explore the
                   synthetic data for potential pay differentials and
                   learn through verifications which findings in the
                   synthetic data hold up and which do not. The analysis
                   on the confidential data reveals pay differentials
                   across races not documented in published studies.},
